Q4. How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently? Write a command for it.
Answer:
You can use git rebase or git reset to delete commits.

1. To delete a commit using git reset:
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
This will delete all commits after the specified commit.

2. To delete a commit using git rebase:
git rebase -i HEAD~3

3. Then, remove the line with the commit you want to delete.
