Q3. How to combine two commits into one commit? For example, you have 4 different commits C1, C2, C3, and C4, and you want to combine C2 and C3 into one single commit.
Answer:
You can use an interactive rebase to combine commits in Git.

Steps:

1. Start an interactive rebase for the last few commits (in this case, 4 commits):
git rebase -i HEAD~4

2. In the editor, change pick to squash for commit C3 (the commit you want to combine with C2):
pick <hash1> C1
pick <hash2> C2
squash <hash3> C3
pick <hash4> C4

3. Save and close the editor.

4. Git will merge the two commits and ask you to edit the commit message.

5. Edit the commit message if needed and complete the rebase.
