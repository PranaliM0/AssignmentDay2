Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case.
Answer:
Git allows you to set multiple remotes for a project. This is useful when you want to push to multiple repositories or clone the same repository in multiple locations.

Use Case:
You might want to push your changes to both a central repository (e.g., GitHub) and a backup repository (e.g., GitLab).

Steps:

Add the primary remote repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git

Add the secondary remote repository:
git remote add backup https://gitlab.com/user/repository.git

Push to both remotes:
git push origin master
git push backup master
