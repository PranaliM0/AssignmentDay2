Q6. How to unstage changes from the staged area? Write the command for it.
Answer:
To unstage changes from the staged area (i.e., move changes from the staging area back to the working directory), use the following command:
git reset <file>

To unstage all changes:
git reset

This will keep your changes in the working directory but remove them from the staged area.
